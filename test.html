        <p>Here is an example of a horizontal rule:</p>
        <br />
        <hr />
        <br />
        <p>To begin, we can change the</p>
        <h1>header size</h1>
        <p>and <span style="color: blue;">color</span> <span style="color: red;">of </span> <span
                style="color: green;">letters</span> seen on the screen. The <span style="font-size: 55px;">font
                size</span> can be changed as well, and actually gives more choices. </p>
        <p>We can also change the appearance of words on the screen. This shows some differing word types in a blocked
            quote. </p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Now is the <i>time</i> for all good <b>people</b> to
            <strong>come</strong> to the <em>aid</em> of their country.</p>
        <p>That was also an example of a nested command.</p>
